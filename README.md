#30-Day Python Coding Challenge
Welcome to my 30-Day Python Coding Challenge repository! This project is a collection of 30 progressively challenging Python projects that I completed over 30 days. The goal was to improve my Python skills by building a variety of programs, starting from beginner level and advancing to intermediate complexity.

About This Challenge
Duration: 30 days

Language: Python 3.x

Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate

Purpose: Learn Python concepts, strengthen problem-solving skills, and build a portfolio of diverse projects.

What You’ll Find Here
Each day features a new project or problem solved with Python. Projects cover different topics, such as:

Basic syntax and control flow

Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)

Functions and recursion

File handling

Object-oriented programming

Simple games and interactive programs

Algorithms and logic puzzles

Project List
Here’s a brief overview of some highlights:

Day	Project Name	Description
1	Hello World & Basics	Introduction to Python syntax
5	Calculator	Basic calculator with operations
10	Quiz Game	Interactive quiz with score tracking
15	Tic Tac Toe	Console-based two-player game
20	Pathfinding Visualizer	Algorithm visualizer (A* and Dijkstra)
25	Breakout Game	Classic arcade game implemented in Python
30	Typing Speed Test	Measure typing speed and accuracy
